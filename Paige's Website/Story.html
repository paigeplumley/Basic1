<ul>One time when I was younger, I was jumping on the trampoline and there was a branch hanging and I tried to be tarzan, but it didn't work. I landed on my back and it was really funny, but it kinda hurt, a lot. Even though I landed on my back, I kept trying, sometimes it worked and was fun, other times it did not work, but was still fun and it hurt. Sometimes when I am babysitting, the kids and I do this and it is super fun and they always ask to keep going.</ul>
